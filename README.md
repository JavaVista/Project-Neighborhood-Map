## Task

I create a Single Page App that allows you to select a list of venues in a Google Map. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## App Functionality

The application shows you the locations of Coffee Shops around the City of Waterbury in CT. The map data is from Google Maps, along with location data from Foursquare.

Some of the features include:

- A large-screen map of the city
- Map markers identifying a number of Coffee Shops around town
- Clicking on a map marker will display the name and address of the venue
- A search box that will display a list view of the identified location
- Clicking on a name in the list, the marker will animate by bouncing on the map to show you the exact location
- It has a Google's Lighthouse Accessibility Rating of 91
- Primarily use for laptop or tablet, but it has been optimized for phone screens as well
- The ability to switch the theme color of the map to a customize color theme called "Brass City"
